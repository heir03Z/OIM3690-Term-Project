              economy. 2. Abundant Marine resources make Japan the second
              largest fishing nation in the world, with a catch of 11.9 million
              tons in 1989. Shallow sea fish account for 50% of the total farmed
              fish, and more than 33% of the total farmed fish Japan has the
              world&#039;s largest fishing fleet and 15% of the global catch. 3.
              Japan is rich in mineral resources because of its volcanic

            Japan has set a target of reducing emissions by 26% in 2030 at the
            level of 2013, and has achieved a reduction of 7% by 2016. In the
            composition of greenhouse gas emissions in Japan, CO 2 accounts for
            92%, of which 50% is due to power generation emissions, which is
            higher than that in other countries. Therefore, promoting non fossil
            energy power generation and realizing low-carbon is an important
            topic for Japan's energy development. The emission of carbon oxide
            mainly comes from the combustion of coal and petroleum products.
            Therefore, the use of fossil fuels in human life is always the main
            cause of carbon dioxide emission. In the process of household energy
            use such as electricity, gas, kerosene and gasoline, if the action
            of saving electricity, energy and carbon dioxide can be implemented,
            the emission of carbon dioxide leading to global warming can be
            restrained. According to the national earth warming prevention
            activity in Japan According to the data of the center, household
            carbon dioxide emissions in 2015 were 179 million tons, accounting
            for 15% of Japan's total emissions [2] The average carbon dioxide
            emission of each household is 4940kg3.1. Household carbon dioxide
            emission. Families need to consume all kinds of materials and energy
            in the process of consumption. The largest carbon dioxide emission
            can not be avoided is that household appliances use 45.3% fuel,
            followed by gasoline, accounting for 27.5%, gas and kerosene,
            accounting for 7.6% and 7.2% respectively. Garbage and natural gas
            also account for 4.8% and 4.3% respectively, and the rest waterways
            and waterways There is also a small amount of diesel, that is,
            household appliances and cars are the main consumption items of
            household fuel. The carbon dioxide emission of lighting household
            appliances is 32.8%, and household cars account for 28.6%. In
            addition, hot water and heating account for 13.2% and 11.6%
            respectively. Garbage waterways and air conditioners account for
            less than 9% in total, which also shows that more carbon dioxide is
            emitted during the use of household appliances and cars, and the
            carbon dioxide emitted by the use of hot water and heating accounts
            for 28.6% The proportion is also more than 24%. 3.2 per capita
            carbon dioxide emissions from the above household energy use and
            various proportions of carbon emissions, and then look at the per
            capita emissions. The carbon dioxide emitted in the process of
            personal daily life is also a great load on the environment

              Japan's energy policy has also strengthened the relevance of the
              carbon market. The current trend shows that Japan will face
              pressure to achieve two emission reduction targets by 2030 and
              2050. First of all, the goal of 2030 is based on Japan's energy
              structure policy, which assumes that 20 ~ 22% of electricity will
              come from nuclear power by 2030, while Japan experienced the
              eastern earthquake in 2011, followed by the nuclear accident in
              Fukushima. In response to the accident, the government raised the
              safety standards of nuclear power plants. Therefore, power
              companies have to invest more in security to meet the new
              standards. In order to meet the technical difficulties or
              additional costs caused by the new safety standards, some power
              companies such as Sanbin or Hegang decided to retire. Even if
              power companies intend to invest to meet safety standards, they
              often face opposition from local communities. There have been
              several legal disputes, and power companies have been asked to
              shut down their nuclear power plants, even though they have passed
              new safety standards. In fact, in several cases, some local courts
              have ordered nuclear power plants to stop operation, and power
              companies must do so. For example, in May 2014, the Fukui District
              Court made a judgment suspending the operation of Kansai power
              company's No. 3 and No. 4 reactors. Therefore, by 2016, nuclear
              power generation in Japan accounted for only 1.6% of total power
              generation. The goal of reducing emissions by 20% by 2030 has
              become more difficult because of the reversal of the development
              trend of nuclear energy caused by the Fukushima nuclear crisis.
              Therefore, Japan must rely more on other energy sources to
              generate electricity. Although the on grid tariff policy was
              relaxed after the earthquake, solar, wind and other renewable
              energy power generation except hydrogen energy accounted for only
              7.8% in 2016. In 2016, most power generation was still based on
              fossil fuels, of which 40.4% came from natural gas and 33.3% from
              coal. In addition, there are many plans to build new coal-fired
              power plants, especially after the deregulation of the power
              industry. One way to overcome this problem is to take advantage of
              overseas emission reduction opportunities. Japan has made full use
              of the clean development mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol,
              including through investment in power and steel enterprises.
              However, the Japanese government withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol
              in 2013, so Japan is not allowed to use CDM emission reductions
              under the Kyoto protocol.
