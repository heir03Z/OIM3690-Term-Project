                <p>Due to the decline in industrial energy demand caused by the economic crisis, Japan's carbon dioxide emissions fell to 1.247 billion tons in 2009, still ranking fifth in the world. This figure is 3% lower than that in 2008.</p>

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
            </div>
            <div label-module="para">Japan has set a target of reducing emissions by 26% in 2030 at the level of 2013, and has achieved a reduction of 7% by 2016. In the composition of greenhouse gas emissions in Japan, CO 2 accounts for 92%, of which 50% is due to power generation
                emissions, which is higher than that in other countries. Therefore, promoting non fossil energy power generation and realizing low-carbon is an important topic for Japan's energy development.</div>
            <div>
                <div label-module="para">The emission of carbon oxide mainly comes from the combustion of coal and petroleum products. Therefore, the use of fossil fuels in human life is always the main cause of carbon dioxide emission. In the process of household energy use
                    such as electricity, gas, kerosene and gasoline, if the action of saving electricity, energy and carbon dioxide can be implemented, the emission of carbon dioxide leading to global warming can be restrained. According to the national
                    earth warming prevention activity in Japan According to the data of the center, household carbon dioxide emissions in 2015 were 179 million tons, accounting for 15% of Japan's total emissions [2] The average carbon dioxide emission
                    of each household is 4940kg3.1. Household carbon dioxide emission. Families need to consume all kinds of materials and energy in the process of consumption. The largest carbon dioxide emission can not be avoided is that household appliances
                    use 45.3% fuel, followed by gasoline, accounting for 27.5%, gas and kerosene, accounting for 7.6% and 7.2% respectively. Garbage and natural gas also account for 4.8% and 4.3% respectively, and the rest waterways and waterways There
                    is also a small amount of diesel, that is, household appliances and cars are the main consumption items of household fuel. The carbon dioxide emission of lighting household appliances is 32.8%, and household cars account for 28.6%.
                    In addition, hot water and heating account for 13.2% and 11.6% respectively. Garbage waterways and air conditioners account for less than 9% in total, which also shows that more carbon dioxide is emitted during the use of household
                    appliances and cars, and the carbon dioxide emitted by the use of hot water and heating accounts for 28.6% The proportion is also more than 24%. 3.2 per capita carbon dioxide emissions from the above household energy use and various
                    proportions of carbon emissions, and then look at the per capita emissions. The carbon dioxide emitted in the process of personal daily life is also a great load on the environment</div>

                <h3>prevention</h3>
            </div>
            <div label-module="para">Japan's energy policy has also strengthened the relevance of the carbon market. The current trend shows that Japan will face pressure to achieve two emission reduction targets by 2030 and 2050. First of all, the goal of 2030 is based on Japan's
                energy structure policy, which assumes that 20 ~ 22% of electricity will come from nuclear power by 2030, while Japan experienced the eastern earthquake in 2011, followed by the nuclear accident in Fukushima. In response to the accident,
                the government raised the safety standards of nuclear power plants. Therefore, power companies have to invest more in security to meet the new standards. In order to meet the technical difficulties or additional costs caused by the new
                safety standards, some power companies such as Sanbin or Hegang decided to retire. Even if power companies intend to invest to meet safety standards, they often face opposition from local communities. There have been several legal disputes,
                and power companies have been asked to shut down their nuclear power plants, even though they have passed new safety standards. In fact, in several cases, some local courts have ordered nuclear power plants to stop operation, and power
                companies must do so. For example, in May 2014, the Fukui District Court made a judgment suspending the operation of Kansai power company's No. 3 and No. 4 reactors. Therefore, by 2016, nuclear power generation in Japan accounted for only
                1.6% of total power generation. The goal of reducing emissions by 20% by 2030 has become more difficult because of the reversal of the development trend of nuclear energy caused by the Fukushima nuclear crisis. Therefore, Japan must rely
                more on other energy sources to generate electricity. Although the on grid tariff policy was relaxed after the earthquake, solar, wind and other renewable energy power generation except hydrogen energy accounted for only 7.8% in 2016.
                In 2016, most power generation was still based on fossil fuels, of which 40.4% came from natural gas and 33.3% from coal. In addition, there are many plans to build new coal-fired power plants, especially after the deregulation of the
                power industry. One way to overcome this problem is to take advantage of overseas emission reduction opportunities. Japan has made full use of the clean development mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol, including through investment in power
                and steel enterprises. However, the Japanese government withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2013, so Japan is not allowed to use CDM emission reductions under the Kyoto protocol.</div>
