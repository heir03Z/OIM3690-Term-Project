          <h3>Total carbon emissions</h3>

            The United States, which ranks second, emits 5.9 billion tons of
            greenhouse gases every year. In addition, the per capita carbon
            dioxide emission of the United States reaches 19.58 tons per year,
            ranking second in the world after China.

        <div label-module="para">
          Carbon emissions have changed dramatically between American cities.
          Generally, the per capita carbon emissions of cities in the western
          United States are lower than those in the Midwest and southeast of the
          United States. The difference is dramatic: when Latin America's carbon
          emissions are a very low amount of 1.413 tons per capita, the carbon
          emissions of 20 cities in the United States are twice that, 2.87 tons
          per capita. As the world's largest carbon emitter, the per capita
          carbon emission of the United States is the highest in the world. The
          total annual carbon emissions from all sources in the United States
          are nearly 6 billion tons.

            The authors of the report attribute the huge differences in carbon
            emissions between American cities to the effects of intensive and
            compact urban development, weather and extensive use of public
            transport in the United States. However, the situation in Seattle is
            puzzling: Seattle is very cold and public transportation is poor,
            but its carbon emissions are relatively low. Scientists say this is
            caused by the use of zero emission hydropower in the northwest of
            the United States. However, the situation in heavy industrial cities
            in the United States where coal burning is serious is usually very
            bad, because burning coal to produce the same electricity emits more
            carbon than hydropower or even natural gas power generation.

          Climate change is a major challenge facing the world, which requires
          countries to respond at the policy level at an unprecedented speed and
          scale. To achieve the goal of completely curbing climate and
          environmental degradation, first of all, countries need to get out of
          the haze of the current new crown (covid-19) pandemic and economic
          collapse, which puts forward multi-level requirements for national
          policy-making departments. In this regard, the United States put
          forward the "zero carbon emission action plan (ZCAP)", which has made
          profound considerations for stabilizing domestic employment, economic
          innovation and coordinated development of the environment in the post
          epidemic era.
